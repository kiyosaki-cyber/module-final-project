                I have just completed the basic education curriculum. Here we used call it the 8-4-4 system, though due to changing times its now it's called the CBC.I studied in Kagumo high school for the secondary education. My learning journey there was not seemless; it had quite some challenges but I managed to triumph.

                I always aspired to become computer literate since I was a child but then I had no means to pursue my desire since I had no knowledge or tools to start with. I'm glad that after quite some time, I have come to get a chance to pursue my desire. This is because <strong> DirectEd Bootcamp</strong>has come and gave me a rare chance to pursue my ambition. They have given me an opportunity to learn web designing at an early stage in my life, thus I will have time to perfect this art.Their curriculum is the <strong>best</strong> I have seen so far. It's tough but it makes you learn and get skills that match the real world outlook. So you have to be strong so that you can reap the benefits of learning web designing. I'm grateful to you DirectEd for giving me this opportunity.
